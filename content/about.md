I'm a lead research engineer at [Dynamo AI (YC 22)](https://dynamo.ai/) based in Amsterdam (NL) / Gdynia (PL). I work on (synthetic) data flywheels, custom evaluations, and training (SFT / RL). What makes it interesting and hard is that the objectives are subjective, under-specified in natural langauge and require iterative human-model alignment.

Before joining Dyanmo I worked in the RL for Combinatorial Optimization and Code Generation teams at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam. I studied Artifical Intelligence at the Univeristy of Amsterdam, specializing in Reinforcement Learning where I did a 9 month intership at [Amsterdam Machine Learning](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) lab with prof. Herke van Hoof.

## Projects I am most proud of:

(i have to think about it)

Outside of work, I love endurance sports! I swim, bike, run, and like Middle Distance Training (70.3 IM) the most. I lack time for other sports but I also do enjoy them: despite failing at learning surfing, I am not giving up :)

**Contact:** if you'd like to chat about AI, go for a bike ride or grab coffee send me a DM on X / LinkedIn / Strava.
