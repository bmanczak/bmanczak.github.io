Despite being ~ a dead end I am also proud of our attempt to use MCTS as a neurally-guided search language model decoding method to provide natural curriculm for learning to write simple programs in zero human data regime (ICML 24’ workshop paper) Demonstrated that (hierarchical) RL can mitiagte congestion in power grids up to 6x more efficiently than a physics based simulator and that hierarchical policies can outperform the non-hierarchical ones. Wrote a paper about it. Outside of work, I love endurance sports and science behind achieving peak human perfromance. I swim, bike, run, and like Middle Distance Training (70.3 IM) the most.
