TL;DR: A simple CLI tool to convert AI chat share links into clean, copy-pasteable conversation formats for easy context switching between different AI tools.<!--more-->

Find yourself switching between different AI chats (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) and AI apps (e.g. Cursor)? 👀

I do! I built myself a tool to make passing whole conversations as context between them super easy. It came up in a few conversations as useful for other people so sharing it widely 🤗

You just get the conversation share link, type `renderchat <share_link>` in your terminal and webpage with ready to copy past conversation pops up.

You can find it here: [renderchat](https://github.com/bmanczak/renderchat)

And here's a quick demo:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 75.15657620041753%; height: 0; margin: 2rem 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/acb40d73daa641c5a4beefd2ba81f678?sid=d02ae68b-1acb-4e3c-ab94-259f5986ea62&speed=2.5" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

This is directly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's rendergit repository which I also use often!
